        <h2>What is emotional intelligence</h2>

        <p>Emotional Intelligence (EI) is the ability to manage both your own emotions and understand the emotions of 
          people around you.</p>

          <p>Emotional intelligence is considered crucial for success in both personal and professional life. It can 
            enhance one's ability to navigate social situations, manage conflicts, and build strong, meaningful 
            relationships. Moreover, it is often associated with effective leadership and teamwork in the workplace.</p>

            <p>Developing emotional intelligence is a lifelong process that can be improved through self-awareness, 
              practice, and feedback. It involves becoming more in tune with your own emotions, as well as being attuned 
              to the emotions of those around you. This self-awareness and empathy can lead to better decision-making, 
              improved interpersonal relationships, and increased overall well-being.</p>

              <h2>difference between Emotional Intelligence and Intelectual quotient</h2>

              <p>IQ tests measure your ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp or communicate complex ideas. 
                EQ tests measure your ability to recognize emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to 
                guide your decisions.</p>

                <p>Emotional Intelligence (EQ) Emotional intelligence is distinct from IQ. â€œYour EQ is the level of your 
                  ability to understand other people, what motivates them and how to work cooperatively with them,
                  In some ways, EQ is far more important and valuable than IQ.</p>

                  <h2>components of EQ</h2>

                  <p><strong>Self-Awareness:</strong>This involves recognizing and understanding your own emotions, 
                    including their triggers and impact on your thoughts and behavior. It also means having a realistic 
                    self-assessment and a strong sense of self-confidence.</p>
                  <p><strong>Self-Regulation:</strong>Self-regulation is the ability to manage and control your emotions,
                     impulses, and reactions. It includes emotional control, adaptability, and the capacity to stay calm 
                     in stressful situations.</p>
                  <p><strong>Motivation:</strong> This aspect of emotional intelligence involves being driven by personal 
                    goals, having a strong sense of purpose, and being able to delay gratification in pursuit of 
                    long-term objectives. It also includes resilience in the face of setbacks.</p>
                  <p><strong>Empathy:</strong> Empathy is the ability to understand and recognize the emotions of others.
                     It involves being able to "put yourself in someone else's shoes" and respond to their emotional 
                     needs with sensitivity.</p>
                  <p><strong>Social Skills:</strong> Social skills encompass a range of abilities, including effective 
                    communication, conflict resolution, and the ability to build and maintain positive relationships.
                     This aspect of emotional intelligence also includes skills related to persuasion, leadership, and 
                     teamwork.</p>
