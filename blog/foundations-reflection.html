<div>
  <h2>Three things I learnt about myself</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I have learnt that I can create myself growth mindset and remove fixed mindset
    </li>
    <li>
      Listen and loop technique practice can expand neuroplasticity and this can help in problem solving 
      process
    </li>
    <li>
      I have learnt also that emotional intelligent is the success factor because help to navigate social 
      situations, manage conflicts, and build strong, meaningful
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2> Taha WhƒÅnau (Family Wellbeing)</h2>
  <p>having dinner with my family every evening. Hangout with my friends every saturday and sunday in soccer practice
    Making calls to my friends for jokes and stories during night before I sleep.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>The role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming</h2>
  <p>The role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming is shape not only how 
    programmers interact with technology but also how they interact with users, colleagues, and the broader 
    society. and this help to produce adequate software and websites.
  </p>

<div>
  <h2>What has surprised me the most about the core learning</h2>
  <p>what surprise me the most about the core learning is how it helped me to discover myself and provide 
    good path of achiving my objecyive through changing my mindset.
  </p>
  <p>Before I used to ask myself how I will gain problem-solving skills expecially in programming but but 
    core learning sorted it out and is helping me a lot.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>The most challenging aspects of the core learning</h2>
  <p>I don't thing there is challenging aspect during core learning because everything is well explained and 
    understandable and this need more practice and taking initiative on some aspect according to the personal 
    weaknesses.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Why programming schools spend more time on core learning</h2>
  <p>I think programming need problem-solving skills and this is why they focus on core learning because it 
    help to develop and shape mind in the way a learner can be on good standard of problem-solving. 
  </p>

  <p>Time I spent studying core learning in Dev Academy was not waste time  and I should not used that 
    to practice programming because when you have ability and skills of problem solving, practice become very 
    easy that is why I focused on core learning, and programming will come during bootcamp. core learning 
    developed my understand and this is helping me understand conceipt.
