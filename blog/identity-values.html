          <h4>How values helped me to take decision</h4>
          <p>I remember when we were in the camp I got a chance of going in United State and we were two people
             competiting for that opportunity and because at that time I was in university with chance of getting 
             ob after my studies but that guy was there without any hope of life and took decision to let him pass and 
             have good life with his familly and that is because of my empathy, compassion and humanity. reflection on 
             this decision is of course positive because he is happy and his familly and that was my objective. 
             sometime I say "wauuu I contributed to someone life change".</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-2">
          <h4>How culture and people influenced my value</h4>
          <p>I spent 26 years in refugee camp where life was hard, sharing everything even salt, respecting each other,
             helping each other, to have same valuesin society and to see people around me suffering influenced my 
             identity and my values.

        </div>

        <div class="col-2">
         <h4>My strengths</h4>
         <p> My strengths are communication, collaboration,working in group and time management and this will support me 
         in this learning journey because programming is about collaboration and communication like when I have stuck 
         or something changed in my personal life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-2">
          <h4>limitations in career developement</h4>
          <p>I had limitation that JavaScript is so hard and I can't to master it and this would affect my learning and 
            career development because programming is all about javaScript </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-2">
         <h4>resistance when working with others</h4>
         <p>In 2021 I got a job in international organisation, after orientation I find myself working in a group of 
          expert people who had much experience on that job and immediately I started feeling inferiority and it was big
           challenge for me to work in that such condition. I told my manager to put me in other group and he made it 
           but it was bad decision to ask for group changing because I would tell the group how I feel among them, 
           stay in that group and learn from them because they had more experience and skills</p>
