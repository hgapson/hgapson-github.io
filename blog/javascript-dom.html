<h2>JavaScript vs HTML and CSS</h2>
<p><strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</strong> HTML is like foundation of house. where room must be, windows, roof and others parts.
  <br> HTML create framework of your website just like how constructors build a house
</p>
<p> <strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong> css play a role of designing the house. colors to paint, shape of house and how 
  everything in the house must look. css make a website good appear by stylish like the way we decorate a house or other 
  thing.</p>
  <p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Imagine you enter in your house and the light turn on automatically, getting in your room and music turn 
    on immediately or when you are in the car without seat belt and your car start bipping. javascript is like all those 
    automatic intallation in you house it add functionality and connection between website and the user. like click a 
    button and webpage turn red or play a video is like the way you enter in your house and the light turn on immediatelly.</p>
  
  </div>
      <div class="javascript">
        <h2>Control flow and loops, arrays, and objects</h2>    
        <p><strong>Control Flow:</strong> Think the way you cook meats, there are steps you have to follow from each other. step 1==> 
          step 2==> step 3... until last step.  This is like the way computer follow instruction according to the output 
          you want.</p>
          <p><strong>Arrays:</strong> Imagine you have have a box and inside there are shoes, every shoes inside the box has range where 
            is the shoes located and those range are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4...when you want a shoes to wear when going to church 
            you will say, oooh the good one is in range 3. this i how computer works when you have a certain action you 
            want to do repeatedly and this is like when you are going to church you will look range 3 and this will 
            save the time you spent thinking where that shoe is.</p>

            <p><strong>Loop:</strong> loop is like giving instruction that will be repeatedly without writing it over and over again. 
              this is like setting alarm of 8:00am every morning without setting it again. this is like in computer 
              where you give instruction of imprementing number every time a user click a button and this will happen
               repeatedly without giving instruictions again.</p>

               <p><strong>Objects:</strong> object is like a school bag where there is something to help you in writing, where to 
                write and other school stuff and all of these has value and names like pen, book, food... in computer, 
                there is object which is like bag where you have to store all you stuffs with names and value and 
                this for keeping your informations that you can need at any moment</p>
      </div>
      <div class="function">
      <h2>Functions and why they are useful</h2>
      <p>Imagine you are a cashier at a grocery store. Your job is to add up the prices of items that customers 
        purchase. You can think of the process as a real-life "adding" function:</p>

        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Your function's purpose is to calculate the total cost of items.
          <strong>Inputs:</strong> The inputs are the prices of the items you scan.
          <strong>Processing:</strong> You add up the prices of the items.
          <strong>Output:</strong> The output is the total cost you tell the customer to pay.</p>

          <p>In both programming and real life, functions encapsulate a series of actions or steps to achieve a 
            specific goal. They take inputs, process them, and produce outputs. This abstraction and modularity make 
            both programming functions and real-life routines effective tools for problem-solving and task completion.</p>

      <div class="dom">
       <h2>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h2>

       <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface and representation of structured documents,
         primarily used for HTML and XML documents. The DOM represents the document's structure as a tree of objects that 
         can be interacted with and manipulated using programming languages like JavaScript.take web page as a book and 
         the book contains letters, paragraphes, images... to manipulate that book like when we want to see a certain 
         picture, we use page to get where that picture is located. in computer DOM is like page </p>

         <h3>The DOM: A Way to Interact with the Document: </h3>

         <p>DOM help to manipulate web and its elements using java scrip and create a dynamic applications or website.</p>

         <h3>Example of Interacting with the DOM:</h3>

         <p><strong>Structured Representation:</strong> The DOM represents the document's structure as a tree of objects, with each object
           corresponding to an element, attribute, or piece of content within the document. This tree structure is called 
           the "DOM tree."</p>

           <p><strong>Accessing Elements:</strong> Developers can access elements within the document using various methods provided by 
            the DOM API. For example, you can access an element by its ID, tag name, class name, or its position within 
            the tree.</p>

            <p><strong>Modifying Content:</strong> Once you've accessed an element, you can modify its content, attributes, or style using
               DOM methods and properties. For example, you can change the text of a paragraph, add or remove HTML 
               elements, or update CSS styles.</p>

               <p><strong>Event Handling:</strong> The DOM allows you to attach event handlers to elements. This means you can define 
                JavaScript functions to run in response to user interactions, such as clicks, keypresses, or form 
                submissions.</p>
