            this will help me deal with bugs and working with group on given project. My limitations is to be scared

          <p>I will be commited by being focused and learn 9 hours a day, using handbook well, participation on discord 
            and learning process with classmates, checking emails from Dev academy regulary and respond to them, help my 
            mates when I have a solution to their questions, asking question whenever I get challenged, attending all 
            weekly check-in, doing more researches, submitting all assessments at time, follow my path and core values. 
            When things are building up and start to get to me I will still be focused on my goal and ask my mentors 
            where I need a help.</p>

          limitations and are the ones who will help me to achieve my goal. <br>
          <br>

          I don't have any other commitment apart from coding. My full focus must be on Dev Academy</p>
