        <h2>Bootcamp Learning plan</h2>
        <h4>My long term goal and career pathway</h4>
        <p>My destination after Dev Academy is looking programming job regardless type of salary because what
           I want is to be a senior software developer, stay connected with colleuges in day to day 
           experience and skills I will gain from Dev Academy will help me to achieve this goal.
          </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4>My biggest strengths and limitations</h4>
        <p>My strengths in bootcamp will be communication, collaboration, time management and goal focus and 
          team player and I hope these will help me to succed as it will be very intense.
        </p>
        <p>My limitation is being scared of something at first sight before I try it like before foundation I 
          was scared of javascript and through core learning I'm trying to remove it and I hope It will be 
          completely changed.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
       <h4>Biggest non-technical challenge at bootcamp</h4>
       <p> The bigest challenge I will face during bootcamp is language. In november will be my first year in New Zealand and my English level is not on good stand where I can understand and speak fluently New Zealanders prononciation and I consider this as challenge because in bootcamp will be teachers and online explanation that will need more English to understand and speak.
       </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4>non-technical skillss I want to develop in bootcam</h4>
        <p>I bootcamp I want to develop of course English speaking and listening because is something I will need in my tech career. 
          Another skill I want to develop is leadership skills, self-awareness and reflective skills because are among skills that will help me in this career.
        </p>

      <div>
       <h4>Expectations from bootcamp team</h4>
       <p>I am new in this career and of course I have expectations from bootcamp team like helping me whenever I have challenge, I expect from the team adaptation because it will be multi-culture group and I spent my whole past life with single culture group.
        </p>
        <p>Another expectation is to give me required knowledge and skills needed in tech career as programmer and help me to adapt to them as well as skills on well being in real life that connected with my career.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4>Expections from myself during bootcamp</h4>
        <p>I don't have more informations about bootcamp and the situation there but I think is the period of full focus on coding and additional skills to foundations' one that are required in programming carrer.

         <p>This is a time where you interact with home group members face to face, facilitators and other people form tech industries and I think there are the one I will ask whenever I get challnged.
