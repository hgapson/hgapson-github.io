  <h2>What is neuroplasticity</h2>

  <p>Neuroplasticity, also known as neural plasticity, or brain plasticity, is the ability of neural networks in the 
    brain to change through growth and reorganization. This refers to the brain's capacity to reorganize its structure, 
    functions, and connections in response to learning, experience, and environmental factors.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>

  <p>Neuroplasticity principles are very useful in the field of rehabilitation because it helps individuals recover from 
    brain injuries, strokes and neurological conditions and this facilitates to recover lost functions.
  </p>
  <p>Neuroplasticity help to recognise that the brain is not fixed but can change and grow encourages people to take on 
    new challenges and learn new skills at any age. this include development  of cognitive recovering techniques 
    to improve memory, attention and problem-solving.
  </p>
  <p>Neuroplacity principles also help in recognizing that continuing learning, cognitive engagement and social 
    interaction can help improve cognitive function as people age.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2> How to engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit</h2>

  <p>You can engage yourself with principles of neoroplasticity by adopting strategies and practices that promote 
    ositive changes in your brain's structure and function like challenge yourself to learn new skills, languages or 
    hobbies regularly.
  </p>
  <p>Practice every time what you learnt like mindfulness or exercising by make them routine. setting goals and 
    objectives for the change you want to make and this give direction a d motivation for your brain to adapt.
  </p>
  <p>By reducing stress and promote emotional regulation you can practice mindfulness and meditation as well as physical 
    exercises because it help in reshaping brain by improving focus and support brain health.
  </p>
  <p>There are other engagement with neuroplasticity principles that can help like diet and nutrition, sleep enough,
    social interaction, challenge yourself, ask and receive help, celebrate progress and others activities. By actively 
    engaging with these principles, you can optimize your brain's potential and facilitate personal growth and well-being.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h2>

  <p>Increasing your neuroplasticity involves engaging in activities and practices that encourage the brain to adapt like 
    staying curios of new things, learning continuously physical exercise and get enough sleep, practice mindfulness and
     meditation, challenge your brain and social interaction all these can help in increase neuroplasticity especially in
      programming journey.

  <h1>MINDSET</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Mindset:</strong> Is a habitual or characteristic mental attitude that determines how you will interpret and 
    respond to situation.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Growth mindset</h2>

  <p>Growth mindset describes a way of viewing challenges and setbacks. People who have a growth mindset believe that 
    even if they struggle with certain skills, their abilities aren't set in stone. They think that with work, their 
    skills can improve over time.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>How Growth Mindset differ form Fixed Mindset</h2>

  <p>Growth mindset is learning, learning and always learning new thing because everything is updated and work hard is a 
    key. Capitalizing on your mistakes and confront your deficiencies help to spend more time studying for the challenges 
    like work hard after disapointing output scores.
    </p>

    <p>Fixed midnset is looking clever at all costs like taking how good you are on something as important than how you 
      want to know more. Fixed mindset come naturally and it hide your mistakes and conceal your deficiencies
    </p>

    <p>Growth mindset is more important when students view challenges as ways of progressing toward their desired 
      outcomes. Students who believe they can develop their talents and abilities see roadblocks and critical feedback 
      as methods to gather information they could use to help themselves learn.
    </p>

    <p>In this exploration I Have suprised that sometimes I used to have fixed mindset but since reading this, my mind 
      already changed because as growth mindeset is, I have to learn and learn. as long as I make mistakes I have to 
      learn from them and this is the way I will succeed in programming journey.
    </p>   
</div>

<div>
  <h2>How growth minset will influence my learning plan and strategy</h2>

  <p>As discussed on my website blog, I have learning plans that must help me to succed in Dev academy include my goal 
    of becoming senior software where I can create my own websites and software, using my strength and remove limitation,
     gaining human skills like problem-solving skills and multi-cultural skills, my commitment of learning 9 hours a day 
     and my expectations from facilitators.
    </p>

    <p>growth mindset will help me to achieve all of these learning plans because my plans demand asking helps from my 
      facilitators and collueges, having hanger of learning new things and and face new challenge to gain new skills 
      and all of these are related to my learning plan and objective.
    </p>

    <p>mind set people have that they know everything decrease neoroplasticity. as long as we push to learn new thing, 
      neoros create strong relationship
