      <h1>PROBLEM SOLVING</h1>
      <p>Problem solving is writing an original program that performs a particular set of tasks and meets all stated 
        constraints.

      <h2>I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>

      <p>When I was writting code during foundation sprint four I was blocked on a simple probem  which is funny to tell 
        and that problem was on manipulating objects where the question was to add a spouse key to terah and assign it 
        with value of adam.
      </p>
      <p>This question is very simple in the way that many people can understand but when I was working on it, my idea 
        was too far from the level of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>After spending like 15 minutes on it, I asked myself why not I'm not doing research because was not not a 
        problem to post on discord, I took decision of googling instead of spending another time on it and I was so 
        surprised on how the solution was just one line of code.
      </p>
      <p>After resolving the question I was asking myself why I needed to go to google on simple question like this and I 
        was laugh at myself but I learnt that programming is asking us to googling every time because the code we are not
         using at the moment is easy to forget it.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>Elegantly solved a problem.</h2>

      <p>fizzbuzz challenge was the problem I solved elegantly because there was no more steps or combination of syntax 
        just if condition. I used trying something method method because I knew what I am thinking is almost true and at 
        the end was true.
      </p>
      <p>I was very happy to solve this challenge because I usually spent minimum 15 minutes on every challenge but this 
        one I spent like 5 minutes and after seeing how it was easy I say "why, I wish every challenge to be like this"
      </p>
      <p>What I learn about this, is that everyone has capability of solving problem through practice and believe in 
        yourself. I solved this problem because I was practising many times if statement because was one of my diffult 
        aspects of javaScript I didn't understand.
      </p>

      <h2> Reflect on how confident I feel using each of the problem-solving techniques</h2>

      <p><strong>Pseudocode:</strong> This technique is not easy to master it because even to know how to divide problem into small part 
        is another skill that is why I can say 60% of confident.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Trying something:</strong> I am on 70% of confident because there are some problems you feel you don't have even an idea 
        of where to start that is why I can't say 100%.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Reading error message:</strong> this is a good technique I enjoyed during this sprint because it show you code line where
         you made error and its explnation. I think I am on 80% of confident even if I find error but without other idea 
         on it but I try to use it most of the time.
        </p>
      <p><strong>console.logging:</strong> I actually like to use it sometimes because it gives you output of small problem and give you
         a way of using another alternative. On this technique I can be on 70% of confident.
        </p>
      <p><strong>Googling:</strong> This is main methos I use when others fail and it help me so much to sort out the problem and have 
        some idea on it. I am 100% on it.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong> Of course this is method I usually use even in my real life because it help to know
         more means I am 100% confident of using it while coding.
        </p>
      <p><strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong> In this foundation process I didn't get many challenges that need to ask coaches
         because I first ask my peers, googling and other methods but I am 100% confident of asking coaches of course.
        </p>
      <p><strong>Improving process with reflection:</strong> This technique is good because of how it help to know weakness and strength 
        through questions. this help me to have confident on 75%.
